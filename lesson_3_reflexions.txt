When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I will want to use a remote repository when i want to share my project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because my remote repository is public and i want to decide what to share


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories on Github.
Used to copy a existing repository on Github wich maintain credits
to the original project.
Clones are copies of repositories in my local machine.
Can clone a repository from Github to my machine or clone a local one.
Branches exists in a unique repository but created when i want to make
changes to the project that can lead me far from the original one.


What is the bebnefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

keping up to date and if (oh no!) you have to go offline can continue your work
with many information as possible.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Less automation without git and github, so talk, talk, talk; many hours...


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would want to make changes into a branch when i'm changing to another
aproach for my project and want to leave the master intact. It's also useful
to work with colaboration and wait until is stable to fuse in the master branch.
