What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a initialize a repository, Git adds a hidden directory
in my folder repository so it can track changes when i do the first commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area gives the possibility to join several files to the same commit.
I don't have to commit files that are in working process or that i don't need anymore
(at least in this version of my work), so the commit points are logic oriented and
makes it easier to find a specific version later on.
